         <h1>What is one piece</h1>
         <p>One Piece (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated      by Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly      Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its individual chapters compiled into 102 tankōbon volumes as of April 2022. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit. With his pirate crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the Grand Line in search of the deceased King of the Pirates Gol D Roger's ultimate treasure known as the "One Piece" in order to become the next King of the Pirates.</p>
         <br>
         <br>
         <p>Most if not all story arcs are grouped into larger sagas, which tend to reflect goals and/or enemies that the Straw Hats pursue across multiple islands.
